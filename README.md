## Introduction

### What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science aiming to build machines that can simulate human-like cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

## Difference between AI and Machine Learning

- **Definition:** AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”. Machine Learning is a subset of AI, where machines can learn from data.

- **Scope:** AI has a broader scope encompassing anything that allows computers to mimic human intelligence, including robotics, natural language processing, and problem-solving. Machine Learning focuses on statistical techniques allowing machines to improve tasks with experience.

## Core Concepts in AI

### Neural Networks
Multi-layered structures inspired by the human brain to process data and extract patterns.

### Deep Learning
A subset of ML, deep learning uses large neural networks with many layers to analyze various factors of data.

### Reinforcement Learning
An area of ML where agents learn how to behave in an environment by performing certain actions and receiving rewards or penalties in return.

## Applications of AI

### Natural Language Processing
Enables machines to understand and respond in human language.

### Computer Vision
Gives machines the ability to visually interpret the world around them.

### Gaming
Implementing AI in strategic games like Chess or Go to simulate human-like opponents.

### Medical Diagnosis
Automatically identifying diseases based on medical images and patient data.

## Advantages and Limitations of AI

- **Advantages:** Speed in data processing, automation, error reduction, capability to work with large data sets.

- **Limitations:** Lack of emotional intelligence, can be expensive, often act as a "black box" making it hard to understand how they derive specific outputs.

## Popular AI Algorithms

- **Decision Trees:** Used in classification and regression tasks.
  
- **Neural Networks:** Useful for pattern recognition.

- **Naive Bayes:** Applied for classification tasks, especially in NLP.

## Future of AI

Discussing trends like quantum computing, AI in healthcare, ethical considerations, etc.

## Hands-on Examples and Tutorials

Providing real-world coding examples and tutorials for readers to grasp the practical aspects of AI.
